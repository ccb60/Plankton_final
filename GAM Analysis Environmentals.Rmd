# Introduction
This notebook provides analyses using GAMs, based on model selection
informed by closer analysis of model collinearity and concurvidity.

In this Notebook, I emphasize physical environmental variables.  The base model includes the following Fixed Effects predictors:

* Temperature  
* Salinity  
* log(Turb)  
* log(Chl)  
* log1p(Fish)  

Year is included in the model as a random effect largely to reduce
unexplained variance in the model.

This means these models omit:

*  Discharge (highly collinear with other predictors),  
*  Oxygen Saturation (Incomplete data and Highly collinear with Temperature),  
*  Season (Highly correlated with multiple predictors, especially Temperature)
*  Station (Moderately correlated with Salinity and Temperature)
*  Sample Event (inclusion as a random factor often led to overspecified models
     and it seldom proved important)

                           sheet="Final", col_types = c("skip", "date", 
                                              "numeric", "text", "numeric",

  rename_with(~ gsub("\\.", "_", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("\\?", "", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("%", "pct", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("_Abundance", "", .x)) %>%

```
```{r}
names(station_data)[10:12]
```


```{r}
names(station_data)[10:12] <- c('disch_wk', 'disch_day', 'disch_max')
```


Station names are arbitrary, and Erin previously expressed interest in renaming 
them from Stations 2, 4, 5 and 8 to Stations 1,2,3,and 4.

The `factor()` function by default sorts levels before assigning numeric codes,
so a convenient way to replace the existing station codes with sequential
numbers is to create a factor and extract the numeric indicator values with 
`as.numeric()`.

```{r change_station_names_2}
station_data <- station_data %>%
  mutate(station = factor(as.numeric(factor(station))))
head(station_data)
```

### Subsetting to Desired Data Columns
I base selection of predictor variables here on the ones used in the manuscript.

```{r build_env_data}
base_data <- station_data %>%
  rename(Date = date, 
         Station = station,
         Year = year) %>%
  select(-c(month, month_num)) %>%
  mutate(Month = factor(as.numeric(format(Date, format = '%m')),
                                                levels = 1:12, 
                                                labels = month.abb),
         DOY = as.numeric(format(Date,format = '%j')),
         season = factor(season, levels = c('Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall')),
         is_sp_up = season == 'Spring' & Station == 1,
         Yearf = factor(Year)) %>%
  rename(Season = season,
         Density = combined_density,
         Temp = ave_temp_c,
         Sal = ave_sal_psu,
         Turb = sur_turb,
         AvgTurb = ave_turb_ntu,
         DOsat = ave_DO_Saturation,
         Chl = ave_chl_microgperl,
         Fish = `___61`,
         RH = Herring
         ) %>%
  select(Date, Station, Year, Yearf, Month, Season, is_sp_up, DOY, riv_km, 
         disch_wk, disch_day, disch_max,
         Temp, Sal, Turb, AvgTurb, DOsat, Chl, 
         Fish, RH, 
         Density, H, SEI,
         Acartia, Balanus, Eurytemora, Polychaete, Pseudocal, Temora) %>%
  arrange(Date, Station)
head(base_data)
```

```{r}
rm(station_data)
```

## Complete Cases
This drops only two samples, one for missing Zooplankton data, one for missing
fish data.  We need this reduced data set to run The `step()` function. It
makes little sense to try stepwise model selection if each time you add or 
remove a variable, the sample you are studying changes.  Since fish is never an
important predictor, we will want need to refit models after stepwise elimination
to use the most complete possible data set.

```{r}
complete_data <- base_data %>%
  select(Season, Station, Yearf,
         is_sp_up, Temp, Sal, Turb, Chl, Fish, RH,
         Density, H, 
         Acartia, Balanus, Eurytemora, Polychaete, Pseudocal, Temora) %>%
  filter(complete.cases(.))
```

## Reduced Data
The low salinity spring samples are doing something rather different, and they
complicate model fitting. Models are far better behaved if we exclude a few
extreme samples.  These are low salinity low zooplankton samples.  We have two 
complementary ways to specify which samples to omit, without just omitting
"outliers". The first is to restrict modeling to "marine" samples over a certain salinity, and the other is to omit spring upstream samples, which include most
of the problematic samples.

```{r}
drop_low <- complete_data %>%
  filter(Sal > 10)    # Pulls three samples, including one fall upstream sample
                      # a fourth low salinity sample lacks zooplankton data
#drop_sp_up <- complete_data %>%
#  filter(! is_sp_up)  # drops four samples
```

# Models of Fish Abundance
## Model 1
```{r}
fish_gam <- gam(log1p(Fish) ~
                  Station +
                  s(Temp, bs="ts", k = 5) +
                  s(Sal, bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                  s(log(Turb), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                  s(log(Chl), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                  s(log1p(Density), bs="ts", k = 5) +
                  s(Yearf, bs = 're'),
                data = complete_data, family = 'gaussian')
summary(fish_gam)
```

Note that the model only explains on the order of 33% of the variance.
```{r}
anova(fish_gam)
```
### Plot GAM Results
```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,3))
plot(fish_gam)
par(oldpar)
```
The GAM fit is highly influenced by a low Density sample with very few fish.

### Concurvidity Analysis
A common recommendation is that values over 0.8 are problematic. We have a few 
values  close to that cutoff.  This analysis, however, is sometimes
misleading with shrinkage estimators, as some terms are nearly removed from the
model. Nevertheless, this model is troubling.

We could get away with including Station in a linear model, but with the GAMs, 
it appears the model including Station has too many problems with
concurvity.

```{r}
concurvity(fish_gam)
```
## Simplified Model
```{r}
fish_gam_2 <- update( fish_gam, .~.-Station)
concurvity(fish_gam_2)
```

```{r}
summary(fish_gam_2)
```

```{r}
anova(fish_gam_2)
```

### Plot GAM Results
```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,3))
plot(fish_gam_2)
par(oldpar)
```

### Model Diagnostics
```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
gam.check(fish_gam_2)
par(oldpar)
```

The model is pretty good, with  slightly skewed and slightly heavy tails
to the residuals and one moderate outlier.

## Model on Reduced Data
We refit to data that omits samples where salinity was below 10 PSU. Based on
our prior analysis, we omit Station as a predictor again, to avoid concurvity
issues.

This reduced data set drops he lowest fish abundance sample in the data set, 
because it happened to coincide with a low salinity (and low plankton density 
sample.

```{r}
fish_gam_no_low <- gam(log1p(Fish) ~
                     s(Temp, bs="ts", k = 5) +
                     s(Sal, bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                     s(log(Turb), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                     s(log(Chl), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                     s(log1p(Density), bs="ts", k = 5) +
                     s(Yearf, bs = 're'),
                     data = drop_low, family = 'gaussian')
summary(fish_gam_no_low)
```

This model explains under 25% of the variance.  The equivalent linear model 
failed to identify any statistically significant predictors, which highlights
the importance of not quite linear relationships.

```{r}
anova(fish_gam_no_low)
```
### Plot GAM Results
```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,3))
plot(fish_gam_no_low)
par(oldpar)
```

Overall, fish abundance is high at very low chlorophyll and drops off at 
log(chlorophyll) ~= 1, or Chlorophyll ~ 2.7. Fish also tends to be
less abundant under low turbidity conditions, but the relationship has high uncertainty.

### Model Diagnostics
```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
gam.check(fish_gam_no_low)
par(oldpar)
```

That model is fairly robust, although it shows some signs of kurtosis.

## Reduced Complexity Model
I drop Temperature, Salinity and Zooplankton density, none of which are significant individually or collectively in various intermediate models not shown)

What remains significant is chlorophyll.  

```{r}
fish_gam_reduced <- gam(log1p(Fish) ~
                     #s(Temp, bs="ts", k = 5) +
                     #s(Sal, bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                     s(log(Turb), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                     s(log(Chl), bs="ts", k = 5)  + 
                     #s(log1p(Density), bs="ts", k = 5)  +
                     s(Yearf, bs = 're'),
                     data = drop_low, family = 'gaussian')
summary(fish_gam_reduced)
```

```{r fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 7}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(1,3))
plot(fish_gam_reduced)
par(oldpar)
```

The reduced model has no impact on the basic conclusions of the model.

# Total Zooplankton Density
I fit the simplified model without Station.  The full model has the same
concurvity problems as before, and here the model fails to converge.  While I
could alter the convergence criteria to search for a solution, we know the model
that includes Station will have concurvity problems, so there is little point.

## Model 1
```{r}
density_gam<- gam(log(Density) ~ 
                          s(Temp, bs="ts", k = 5) +
                          s(Sal, bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                          s(log(Turb), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                          s(log(Chl), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                          s(log1p(Fish),bs="ts", k = 5) +
                          s(Yearf, bs = 're'), 
                        data = complete_data, family = 'gaussian')
concurvity(density_gam)
```

```{r}
summary(density_gam)
```

```{r}
anova(density_gam)
```


### Plot the GAM
```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,3))
plot(density_gam)
par(oldpar)
```

The only significnatly non-linear response is the response for salinity,
which appears to be driven by a few very low salinity samples.

## Model on Reduced Data
```{r}
density_gam_no_low<- gam(log(Density) ~ 
                          s(Temp, bs="ts", k = 5) +
                          s(Sal, bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                          s(log(Turb), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                          s(log(Chl), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                          s(log1p(Fish),bs="ts", k = 5) +
                          s(Yearf, bs = 're'), 
                        data = drop_low, family = 'gaussian')
summary(density_gam_no_low)
```

```{r}
anova(density_gam_no_low)
```

## Plot the GAM
```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,3))
plot(density_gam_no_low)
par(oldpar)
```

## Reduced Complexity Model
```{r}
density_gam_reduced<- gam(log(Density) ~ 
                          #s(Temp, bs="ts", k = 5) +
                          #s(Sal, bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                          s(log(Turb), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                          s(log(Chl), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                          #s(log1p(Fish),bs="ts", k = 5) +
                          s(Yearf, bs = 're'), 
                        data = drop_low, family = 'gaussian')
summary(density_gam_reduced)

```
```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,3))
plot(density_gam_reduced)
par(oldpar)
```
Again, results are little affected by removing non-significant terms.  Even this
simple model predicts on the order of 60% of the variance.

# Shannon Diversity
## Model 1
```{r}
shannon_gam <- gam(H ~ 
                     s(Temp, bs="ts", k = 5) +
                     s(Sal, bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                     s(log(Turb), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                     s(log(Chl), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                     s(log1p(Fish),bs="ts", k = 5) +
                     s(Yearf, bs = 're'),
                   data = complete_data, family = 'gaussian')
summary(shannon_gam)
```

```{r}
anova(shannon_gam)
```

### Plot the GAM
```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,3))
plot(shannon_gam)
par(oldpar)
```

Again, the relationship with salinity appear principally driven by a couple of
very low salinity outliers.

## Model on Reduced Data
```{r}
shannon_gam_no_low <- gam(H ~ 
                     s(Temp, bs="ts", k = 5) +
                     s(Sal, bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                     s(log(Turb), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                     s(log(Chl), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                     s(log1p(Fish),bs="ts", k = 5) +
                     s(Yearf, bs = 're'),
                   data = drop_low, family = 'gaussian')
summary(shannon_gam_no_low)
```

```{r}
anova(shannon_gam_no_low)
```

### Plot the GAM
```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,3))
plot(shannon_gam_no_low)
par(oldpar)
```
Plankton diversity is highest at low temperatures and at intermediate levels
of chlorophyll.  Neither of those patterns was uncovered by the linear model
analysis.

## Diagnostic Plots
```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
gam.check(shannon_gam_no_low)
par(oldpar)
```

Model looks excellent.

# Single Species Models
## Model Choice
Our model alternatives are similar to the choices we had for the Total Density 
model. The problem is, we can't use any of the continuous data distributions in 
GAMS with zero values (at least relying on the canonical link functions) because
(log(0) = -Inf; 1/0 = Inf, 1 / 0*0 = Inf). The easiest solution is to add some 
finite small quantity to the density data, and predict that. Here we predict
log(Density + 1) using Gaussian models.

## Automating Analysis of Separate Species
I'm going to automate analysis of all selected species by using a "nested"
Tibble.  This is a convenient alternative to writing a "for" loop to run
multiple identical analyses.

I create a "long" data source, based on the reduced data set that omits low
salinity samples.

```{r}
spp_data <- drop_low %>%
  select(Yearf, Season, Station, Temp,
          Sal, Turb, Chl, Fish, 
          Acartia, Balanus, Eurytemora, Polychaete, Pseudocal, Temora) %>%
  pivot_longer(-c(Yearf:Fish), names_to = 'Species', values_to = 'Density')
```

Next, I create a function to run the analysis.  This function takes a data frame
or tibble as an argument.  The tibble mush have data columns with the correct 
names.

The initial model fits for some species had a lot of wiggles in them, to an 
extent that I thought did not make much scientific sense, so I decided to reduce
the dimensionality of the GAM smoothers, by adding the parameter `k= 4`. Lowe
numbers constrain the GAM to fit smoother lines.

```{r}
my_gam <- function(.dat) {
  
  gam(log1p(Density) ~ 
        s(Temp, bs="ts", k = 5) +
        s(Sal, bs="ts", k = 5) + 
        s(log(Turb), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
        s(log(Chl), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
        s(log1p(Fish),bs="ts", k = 5) +
        s(Yearf, bs = 're'),
      data = .dat, family = "gaussian")
}
```


Next, I create the nested tibble, and conduct the analysis on each species....

```{r}
spp_analysis <- spp_data %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(gam_mods = map(data, my_gam))
```

and finally, output the model results.  I can do that in a "for" loop, but it's 
Awkward to look through a long list of output, so I step through each species in turn.
