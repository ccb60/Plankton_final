Final versions of analysis of data on zooplankton in the Penobscot Estuary 
for Ambrose et al. 2022 manuscript.

Erin Ambrose recently prepared a manuscript based on her graduate work looking 
at species composition of plankton in Penobscot Bay, Maine, working with Rachel
Lasley Rasher, at the University of Southern Maine. Lasley Rasher is on the 
faculty  at the University of Southern Maine, which also hosts the Casco Bay 
Estuary Partnership.  

At Lasley Rasher's request, I helped Ambrose early on in her graduate work with
some R coding issues, and later assisted with preparing graphics for the 
manuscript.

Comments back from reviewers on Ambrose's manuscript raised some fairly deep
questions about how to discuss, analyze, and visualize patterns in the complex
spatio-temporal environment of Maine estuaries.  We explored many different
approaches to statistical modeling of these data in companion Github
repositories (Plankton_Reanalysis; zooplankton_causal_analysis). As is common
during exploratory analysis, we tested many different models to determine
srengths and weaknesses of different modeling approaches.

This repository includes final analyses and R notebooks used to generate the
"Supplementary Information" that will accompany the manuscript.  As such, it
omits examples and code that were principally of value for testing 
alternative model strategies, and omits some model diagnostics not important
for telling the larger story of our data analysis.
