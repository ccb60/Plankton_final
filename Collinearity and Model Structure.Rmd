# Introduction
This notebook looks closely at the effect of colinearity on LMER models for 
plankton community composition in Penobscot Bay.

## Colinearities
Correlations among predictors are fairly high, so different predictors 
'confound' each other.  Values (and sometimes even the sign) of model parameters 
are dependent on which other terms are retained in each model.

The problem with colinearity is that the interpretation of relationships 
between predictors and response variables can depend on which other terms are
retained in the model.  

Estuaries are full of expected correlations among environmental variables,
driven by seasonality, river discharge, estuary mixing dynamics etc.  In Maine,
during the warmer months of the year, river water is significantly warmer than
ocean water, so location in the estuary (upstream vs. downstream), seasonality,
temperature and salinity are all interrelated. Estuarine processes can further 
generate correlations among other environmental variables.

This complicates fitting of regression models in estuarine environments, as 
environmental variables are not independent, leading to difficulties with
model specification.

## A Note on Degrees of Freedom
We have just under 60 complete cases available, and as our models grow
increasingly complex, we burn up degrees of freedom. The "full" linear mixed
effects model used here has the following degrees of freedom:

Source                  | Degrees of Freedom
------------------------|---------------
Intercept               | 1
Year (Random)           | 1 *
Sample Day (Random)     | 1 *
Station                 | 3
Season                  | 2
is_sp_up                | 1
Temp                    | 1
Sal                     | 1
log(Turb)               | 1
log(Chl)                | 1
log1p(Fish)             | 1
*Total*                 | *14*

Adding an interaction term between Station and Season (instead of fitting the 
"is_sp_up" term) adds $3 \times 2 - 1 - 1 = 4$ further degrees of freedom. 

The "GAM" models we tested use multiple degrees of freedom to estimate each
non-linear fit, so we often need to restrict the dimension of the smoothers
to avoid using up all available degrees of freedom.  The GAM models are complex
models to fit to a fairly small data set.

filename.in <- "penob.station.data EA 3.12.20.xlsx"
file_path <- file.path(data_folder, filename.in)
station_data <- read_excel(file_path, 
                           sheet="Final", col_types = c("skip", "date", 
                                              "numeric", "text", "numeric",

  rename_with(~ gsub("\\.", "_", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("\\?", "", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("%", "pct", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("_Abundance", "", .x)) %>%
  filter(! is.na(date))
```

```{r}
names(station_data)[10:12]

names(station_data)[10:12] <- c('disch_wk', 'disch_day', 'disch_max')
```

Station names are arbitrary, and Erin expressed interest in renaming them from
Stations 2, 4, 5 and 8 to Stations 1, 2, 3,and 4.

The `factor()` function by default sorts levels before assigning numeric codes,
so a convenient way to replace the existing station codes with sequential
numbers is to create a factor and extract the numeric indicator values with 
`as.numeric()`.

```{r change_station_names_2}
station_data <- station_data %>%
  mutate(station = factor(as.numeric(factor(station))))
head(station_data)
```

##  Scaling values
I divide two predictor variables by 1000 to reduce numerical problems
with model fitting.
```{r}
range(station_data$disch_wk)
range(station_data$`___61`, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
station_data <- station_data %>%
  mutate(Fish = `___61` / 1000, 
         disch_wk = disch_wk/1000)  %>%  # to reduce scale issues in model fit
  select(-`___61`)
```

```{r}
range(station_data$disch_wk)
range(station_data$Fish, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Subsetting to Desired Data Columns
I base selection of predictor variables here on the ones used in the manuscript,
plus River Discharge. The three Discharge estimators are highly correlated.  I 
selected the weekly discharge figure because I felt it probably reflected recent
conditions better than a daily discharge value, but honestly, it makes little
difference.

```{r build_env_data}
base_data <- station_data %>%
  rename(Date = date, 
         Station = station,
         Year = year) %>%
  select(-c(month, month_num)) %>%
  mutate(Month = factor(as.numeric(format(Date, format = '%m')),
                                                levels = 1:12, 
                                                labels = month.abb),
         DOY = as.numeric(format(Date,format = '%j')),
         season = factor(season, levels = c('Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall')),
         is_sp_up = season == 'Spring' & Station == 1,
         Yearf = factor(Year)) %>%
  rename(Season = season,
         Temp = ave_temp_c,
         Sal = ave_sal_psu,
         Turb = sur_turb,
         AvgTurb = ave_turb_ntu,
         DOsat = ave_DO_Saturation,
         Chl = ave_chl_microgperl,
         RH = Herring
         ) %>%
  select(Date, Station, Year, Yearf, Month, Season, is_sp_up, DOY, riv_km, 
         disch_wk, disch_day, disch_max,
         Temp, Sal, Turb, AvgTurb, DOsat, Chl, 
         Fish, RH, 
         combined_density, H, SEI,
         Acartia, Balanus, Eurytemora, Polychaete, Pseudocal, Temora) %>%
  arrange(Date, Station)
head(base_data)
```

```{r}
rm(station_data)
```

## Complete Cases
This drops two samples, one with missing Zooplankton data (leading to our normal
sample size of 59 samples), and one for missing fish data.  We need this reduced
data set to compare sequential models where we want to evaluate the importance
of either fish or zooplankton as predictors (at least if we want to use model
comparisons via AIC or likelihood).

```{r}
complete_data <- base_data %>%
  select(Season, Station, Yearf, disch_wk,
         is_sp_up, Temp, Sal, Turb, Chl, DOsat, Fish, RH,
         combined_density, H, 
         Acartia, Balanus, Eurytemora, Polychaete, Pseudocal, Temora) %>%
  filter(complete.cases(.))
```

## Drop Low Salinity Observations
The low salinity spring samples are doing something rather different, and they
complicate model fitting. Models are far better behaved if we exclude a few
extreme samples.  These are low salinity low zooplankton samples.  We have two 
complementary ways to specify which samples to omit, without just omitting
"outliers". The first is to restrict modeling to "marine" samples over a certain salinity, and the other is to omit spring upstream samples, which include most
of the problematic samples.

```{r}
drop_low <- complete_data %>%
  filter(Sal > 10)    # Pulls three samples, including one fall upstream sample
drop_v_low <- complete_data %>%
  filter(Sal > 5)     # drops two Samples, both spring Samples
drop_sp_up <- complete_data %>%
  filter(! is_sp_up)  # drops four samples
```

# Correlations Among Predictors
Pairwise comparisons are a good place to start.  To make it marginally easier
to look at Season and Station via `cor()`, I convert them to numeric values.  
This means the correlations are only linear associations, and don't reflect any
non-linearities (which we actually know exist).  But it's a good first step.

The following uses Spearman Rank correlations, to minimize the potential effect
of different monotonic transformations of predictors on the reported 
correlations.

## The Complete Data
```{r}
complete_data %>%
  select(Season, Station, c(disch_wk:Fish),  -is_sp_up) %>%
  mutate(Season = as.numeric(Season), 
         Station = as.numeric(Station)) %>%
  cor(method = 'spearman', use = 'pairwise') %>%
  round(3)
```
*  Season is associated with Discharge, Temperature, Salinity, Chlorophyll  and
   dissolved oxygen saturation.
   
*  Station is also moderately correlated with Salinity,  Turbidity and
   chlorophyll

*  Discharge is highly correlated (in absolute value) with multiple possible
   predictor variables, especially Season, temperature, and Chlorophyll and
   dissolved oxygen.
   
*  Dissolved oxygen is correlated with many predictors at intermediate values.


## Reduced Data
### Drop Low Salinity Samples
While dropping extreme samples (drop three low salinity samples)
```{r}
drop_low %>%
  select(Season, Station, c(disch_wk:Fish),  -is_sp_up) %>%
  mutate(Season = as.numeric(Season), 
         Station = as.numeric(Station)) %>%
  cor(use = 'pairwise') %>%
  round(3)
```

*  Discharge is still highly correlated with Season and Temperature.  The
   correlation with salinity is somewhat reduced.
  
*  Season is still highly correlated with temperature, but the connection with 
   salinity is slightly reduced.

*  Station is still moderately correlated with Temperature, Salinity, and 
   turbidity.
   
### Drop all upstream spring samples
```{r}
drop_sp_up%>%
  select(Season, Station, c(disch_wk:Fish), -is_sp_up) %>%
  mutate(Season = as.numeric(Season), 
         Station = as.numeric(Station)) %>%
  cor(use = 'pairwise') %>%
  round(3)
```

That is more or less the same as our prior data subsets.

# PCA of Predictors 
One way to look at correlations among variables is to look at a principal
components analysis of explanatory variables. Variables that have a high loading
on important PCA axes are highly colinear with the other variables included in 
the PCA. 

The problem in using a PCA this way is that results depend somewhat on how each
predictor will be transformed in the eventual models. We transform the 
predictors the way we have been including them in models, based on prior work.

The PCA based on the covariance matrix (equivalent to not scaling variables 
before conducting the PCA) is dominated by discharge, which alone accounts for
high proportion of overall pattern. 

High discharge samples are associated with high discharge spring events in
2013 and 2017. Quickly perusing the data shows that they are cooler temperature,
slightly low salinity,  high dissolved oxygen samples. That impression is 
confirmed by the PCA. 

```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6}
test <- complete_data %>%
  mutate(Turb = log(Turb),
         Chl = log(Chl),
         Fish = log1p(Fish)) %>%
  select(c(disch_wk:Fish ), - is_sp_up)  %>%
  prcomp(scale. = FALSE)
biplot(test)
```

```{r}
summary(test)
```

```{r}
test$rotation
```

Axis 1, which accounts for just over 3/4 of the variance, is nearly synonymous
with discharge. 

Axis 2 is "mostly" dissolved oxygen,  but it explains much less
of the structure in the data, and we are missing dissolved oxygen data from 
2013.

Axis 3 is associated with salinity, and explains nearly as much of the structure
among predictors as dissolved oxygen.

Cumulatively, we've got about 89% of the variance (information) in the
correlation matrix explained by the first two PCA axes, and 99% explained by the
first three.  But most of the structure is in Axis 1, suggesting any model that
includes Discharge is going to be problematic.

## In the absence of Discharge
```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6}
test <- complete_data %>%
  mutate(Turb = log(Turb),
         Chl = log(Chl),
         Fish = log1p(Fish)) %>%
  select(c(Temp:Fish), -is_sp_up)  %>%
  prcomp(scale. = FALSE)
biplot(test)
```

```{r}
summary(test)
```
So Axis 1 now explains only 58% of the structure in the predictor variables.  We
are likely to have fewer problems with colinearity if we omit Discharge from
our models.

```{r}
test$rotation
```

## Drop DO Saturation
```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6}
test <- complete_data %>%
  mutate(Turb = log(Turb),
         Chl = log(Chl),
         Fish = log1p(Fish)) %>%
  select(c(Temp:Fish), -is_sp_up, -DOsat)  %>%
  prcomp(scale. = FALSE)
biplot(test)
```

```{r}
summary(test)
```
Axis 1 explains 69%% of the structure in the predictor variables, but pretty
much all of the structure in the predictors is explained by axis 1, with high
loading on Salinity, and axis 2, with high loading on Temperature.

```{r}
test$rotation
```

## Conclusions
*  The large loading of Discharge on the first PCA axis tells us that it is
   close to colinear with some linear combination of the other predictors.  Any
   model including Discharge is going to have problems with colinearity.

*  The moderate loading on dissolved oxygen on Axis 2 is less problematic, but
   we lack dissolved oxygen data for 2013, so we chose to omit DO from our
   models as well.
   
*  This analysis does not address strong statistical associations between our
   experimental factors, Season and Station, and the measured environmental
   variables.  
   *  Season tends to be associated fairly strongly with temperature, as 
      water temperatures are lower across the board in spring (especially in the
      upper estuary).  
   *  Station tends to be associated with salinity, with lower salinity in the 
      upper watershed, especially in spring.

*  We are likely to have trouble interpreting model coefficients for models that
   include both Season and Temperature or both Station and Salinity.

# LMER Models of Zooplankton Density
We focus on linear models instead of GAMS because we can use standard methods
to evaluate the importance of colinearity. The only random factor we include in 
these models is Year.  much of this modelling could be managed as linear 
models with only limited loss of information.

## Full Model
We start with a "full" model and demonstrate the problem of colinearity that 
arises.

```{r}
density_lmer <- lmer(log1p(combined_density) ~ 
                     Station + Season + 
                      Temp +
                      Sal + 
                      disch_wk +
                      log(Turb) + 
                      log(Chl) + 
                      log1p(Fish) + 
                     (1 | Yearf),
                   data = base_data, na.action = na.omit, REML = FALSE)
vif(density_lmer)
```
We  have many problems with colinearity, especially with Temperature, salinity,
discharge, Season and possibly Station


## Reduced Model
First I drop discharge.
```{r}
density_lmer <- lmer(log1p(combined_density) ~ 
                     Station + Season + 
                      Temp +
                      Sal + 
                      #disch_wk +
                      log(Turb) + 
                      log(Chl) + 
                      log1p(Fish) + 
                     (1 | Yearf),
                   data = base_data, na.action = na.omit, REML = FALSE)
vif(density_lmer)
```

We see Season, Temperature and perhaps Station continue to be problems.

## Final Model
We drop Season from the model next.

```{r}
density_lmer <- lmer(log1p(combined_density) ~ 
                     Station + 
                      #Season + 
                      Temp +
                      Sal + 
                      #disch_wk +
                      log(Turb) + 
                      log(Chl) + 
                      log1p(Fish) + 
                     (1 | Yearf),
                   data = base_data, na.action = na.omit, REML = FALSE)
vif(density_lmer)
```
No remaining terms have especially high VIF (when appropriately scaled to 
degrees of freedom), so we can  stop here.

## Alternative Model Family
We could go the other direction, and instead of dropping Season, we could retain
it and drop highly correlated predictor variables, especially temperature. 
Salinity is some what correlated with Station, so dropping it also assists with model colinearity problems.

```{r}
density_lmer_alt <- lmer(log1p(combined_density) ~ 
                     Station + 
                     Season + 
                     # Temp +
                     #Sal + 
                      #disch_wk +
                      log(Turb) + 
                      log(Chl) + 
                      log1p(Fish) + 
                     (1 | Yearf),
                   data = base_data, na.action = na.omit, REML = FALSE)
vif(density_lmer_alt)
```


## Conclusions
In effect, what this shows is that we can **either** talk in terms of season and
Station, or in terms of salinity and temperature, but that if we try to do both
at once, we are going to have problems with colinearity, making model
interpretation messy.

# LMER Models of Fish Abundance
## Full model
```{r}
fish_lmer <- lmer(log1p(Fish) ~ 
                     Station + 
                     Season + 
                      Temp +
                      Sal + 
                      disch_wk +
                      log(Turb) + 
                      log(Chl) + 
                      log1p(combined_density) + 
                     (1 | Yearf),
                   data = base_data, na.action = na.omit, REML = FALSE)
vif(fish_lmer)
```

We have many problems with colinearity here, as expected.

## Reduced Model
First lets drop discharge.  Note that i this fit, `Yearf` has so little effect
on the model that the `lmer()` algorithm judges it to have zero variance. 
In other words, the random structure of the model provides no benefit.

```{r}
fish_lmer <- lmer(log1p(Fish) ~ 
                     Station + Season + 
                      Temp +
                      Sal + 
                      #disch_wk +
                      log(Turb) + 
                      log(Chl) + 
                      log1p(combined_density) + 
                     (1 | Yearf),
                   data = base_data, na.action = na.omit, REML = FALSE)
vif(fish_lmer)
```

We see Season, temperature continue to problems, just as for the zooplankton 
models.

## Final Model
We drop Season next.

```{r}
fish_lmer <- lmer(log1p(Fish) ~ 
                     Station +
                     #Season + 
                      Temp +
                      Sal + 
                      #disch_wk +
                      log(Turb) + 
                      log(Chl) + 
                      log1p(combined_density) + 
                     (1 | Yearf),
                   data = base_data, na.action = na.omit, REML = FALSE)
vif(fish_lmer)
```
We again see that no remaining terms have especially high VIF, so we can stop 
here.

## Alternative Model Family
```{r}
fish_lmer <- lmer(log1p(Fish) ~ 
                     Station + 
                     Season + 
                      #Temp +
                      Sal + 
                      #disch_wk +
                      log(Turb) + 
                      log(Chl) + 
                      log1p(combined_density) + 
                     (1 | Yearf),
                   data = base_data, na.action = na.omit, REML = FALSE)
vif(fish_lmer)
```

So, dropping Discharge and Temperature  (NOT salinity this time) produces
a model with limited problems due to colinearity. Things do get slightly better (from a VIF perspective) if you drop Salinity from the model as well.

# Models on Reduced Data
Even if we fit models to the reduced data, we find colinearities are still
fairly high, so we still need to  drop both Discharge and Season to ensure
decent VIF.

```{r}
density_lmer_drop <- lmer(log1p(combined_density) ~ 
                     Station + Season + 
                      Temp +
                      Sal + 
                      disch_wk +
                      log(Turb) + 
                      log(Chl) + 
                      log1p(Fish) + 
                     (1 | Yearf),
                   data = drop_low, na.action = na.omit, REML = FALSE)
vif(density_lmer_drop)
```

```{r}
density_lmer_drop <- lmer(log1p(combined_density) ~ 
                     Station + 
                      #Season + 
                      Temp +
                      Sal + 
                      #disch_wk +
                      log(Turb) + 
                      log(Chl) + 
                      log1p(Fish) + 
                     (1 | Yearf),
                   data = drop_low, na.action = na.omit, REML = FALSE)
vif(density_lmer_drop)
```

# Conclusions

Our "Standard" models will exclude discharge, and take two forms:

1.  **Season and Station Models**  include Season and Station, but omit
    Temperature and Salinity.

2.  **Environment Models** that omit Season, but include Temperature and 
    Salinity. They will include Station where it does not pose high colinearity
    or concurvity problems, but omit Station if it does.
