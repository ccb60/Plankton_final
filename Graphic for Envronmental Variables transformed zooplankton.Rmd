# Introduction
A central challenge of making sense of ecological processes complex estuary 
environments is that conditions in the estuary vary in complex ways in time and 
space.  Mixing of fresh and salt water creates steep three dimensional ecotones
of salinity, temperature, and water density. Those ecotones drive local
hydrodynamics that can concentrate nutrients or particulates in certain times or
places, while diluting them or washing them out of the estuary elsewhere. The 
ecotones themselves shape the spatio-temporal structure of both "predictors" and
"responses".

In this notebook, I look at ideas for graphically depicting the spatio-temporal 
structure of all measured variable.  Other notebooks examine the use of
sequential models and path models for understanding estuary structure. Here, I 
focus on graphic exposition only, using R and `ggplot2` as the graphics engine.

This notebook is a variation of the "Graphics for Environmental Variables" 
notebook that explores whether the Zooplankton variable should be log
transformed.  We used a log-transformed value in all of the data analyses
because it made sense from a modeling perspective.

# Load Libraries
```{r libraries, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(mgcv)      # for GAM models
library(emmeans)   # For extracting useful "marginal" model summaries

theme_set(theme_classic())
```

# Load Data
## Folder References
```{r folder_refs}
data_folder <- "Original_Data"

dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

## Load Data From Source
```{r load_enviro_data}
filename.in <- "penob.station.data EA 3.12.20.xlsx"
file_path <- file.path(data_folder, filename.in)
station_data <- read_excel(file_path, 
                           sheet="Final", col_types = c("skip", "date", 
                                              "numeric", "text", "numeric", 
                                              "text", "skip", "skip", 
                                              "skip", 
                                              rep("numeric", 10),
                                              "text", 
                                              rep("numeric", 47),
                                              "text",
                                              rep("numeric", 12))) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub(" ", "_", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("\\.", "_", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("\\?", "", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("%", "pct", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("_Abundance", "", .x)) %>%
  filter(! is.na(date))

station_data <- station_data %>%
  mutate(station = factor(as.numeric(factor(station))))
```

## Subsetting to Desired Data
I base selection of predictor variables here on the ones used for the 
environmental loading in the community analysis.

```{r build_env_data}
base_data <- station_data %>%
  rename(Date = date, 
         Station = station,
         Year = year) %>%
  select(-c(month, month_num)) %>%
   mutate(Month = factor(as.numeric(format(Date, format = '%m')),
                                                levels = 1:12, 
                                                labels = month.abb),
         DOY = as.numeric(format(Date,format = '%j')),
         Station =factor(Station),
         season = factor(season, levels = c('Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall')),
         Yearf = factor(Year)) %>%
  rename(Season = season,
         Temp = ave_temp_c,
         Sal = ave_sal_psu,
         Turb = sur_turb,
         AvgTurb = ave_turb_ntu,
         DOsat = ave_DO_Saturation,
         Chl = ave_chl_microgperl,
         Fish = `___61`,
         Zoopl = combined_density,
         Diversity = H
         ) %>%
  select(Date, Station, Year, Yearf, Month, Season, 
               DOY, riv_km, Temp, Sal, Turb, AvgTurb, 
         DOsat, Chl, Fish, 
         Zoopl, Diversity, SEI,
         Acartia, Balanus, Eurytemora, Polychaete, Pseudocal, Temora) %>%
  arrange(Date, Station)
head(base_data)
```

```{r}
rm(station_data)
```

## Base Graphic Design -- Untransformed Zooplankton
We represent location only as "Station", not River Kilometer.  This has the
advantage of placing upstream to the left.

```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(base_data, aes(as.numeric(Station), Zoopl, color = Season)) +
  stat_summary(geom = 'line', lwd = 1) +
  stat_summary(geom = 'errorbar', width = 0.15, lwd = 1) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = factor(Year)), alpha = 0.5) +

  xlab('Station') +
  ylab(expression("Zooplankton (" * m ^-3 ~ ")" )) +
  
  scale_shape(name = 'Year') +
  
  # All the following is unnecessary here, since  these are mostly defaults, but
  # I Include them as reminders of how to control the legend.
  theme(legend.position = 'right', 
        legend.box = 'vertical',
        legend.title.align = 0) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(title.position = "top"),
         shape = guide_legend(title.position = "top"))
```
```{r}
ggsave('figures/Zooplankton_untransformed.png',
         width = 5, height = 3)
ggsave('figures/Zooplankton_untransformed.pdf', device = cairo_pdf, 
       width = 5, height = 3)
