# Introduction
This notebook includes analyses using GAMs, based on analysis of model 
colinearity and concurvidity.

In this Notebook, I emphasize Season and Station as factors to explain patterns
in the zooplankton data. These terms are fairly highly correlated with
Temperature and Salinity, so including terms for Season and Station more or less
preculdes including Salinity and Temperature in a GAM model.

Where I have compaared models, the Season and Station models generally don't 
perform as well as the models based on quantitative environmental predictors
(based on AIC), but I have not compared all paire of such models.

The base model here includes the following Fixed Effects predictors:

* Season

* Station 

* Temperature 

* Salinity 

* log(Turb) 

* log(Chl) 

* log1p(Fish) 

Year is included in the model as a random effect largely to reduce
unexplained variance in the model.

This means these models omit:

* Discharge (highly colinear with other predictors),

* Oxygen Saturation (Incomplete data; highly colinear with Temperature and thus
  Season and Station).

* Temperature (Highly correlated with Season and somewhat correlated with
  Station),

* Salinity (Highly correlated with Station and somewhat correlated with
  Season),

* Sample Event (inclusion as a random factor often led to overspecified models
   and it seldom proved important)

## Load Data
```{r load_enviro_data}
filename.in <- "penob.station.data EA 3.12.20.xlsx"
file_path <- file.path(data_folder, filename.in)
station_data <- read_excel(file_path, 
              sheet="Final", col_types = c("skip", "date", 
                       "numeric", "text", "numeric",

                       rep("numeric", 47),

```
```{r}
names(station_data)[10:12]
```


```{r}
names(station_data)[10:12] <- c('disch_wk', 'disch_day', 'disch_max')
```


Station names are arbitrary, and Erin previously expressed interest in renaming 
them from Stations 2, 4, 5 and 8 to Stations 1,2,3,and 4.

The `factor()` function by default sorts levels before assigning numeric codes,
so a convenient way to replace the existing station codes with sequential
numbers is to create a factor and extract the numeric indicator values with 
`as.numeric()`.

```{r change_station_names_2}
station_data <- station_data %>%
 mutate(station = factor(as.numeric(factor(station))))
head(station_data)
```

### Subsetting to Desired Data Columns
I base selection of predictor variables here on the ones used in the manuscript.

```{r build_env_data}
base_data <- station_data %>%
 rename(Date = date, 
     Station = station,
     Year = year) %>%
 select(-c(month, month_num)) %>%
 mutate(Month = factor(as.numeric(format(Date, format = '%m')),
                        levels = 1:12, 
                        labels = month.abb),
     DOY = as.numeric(format(Date,format = '%j')),
     season = factor(season, levels = c('Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall')),
     is_sp_up = season == 'Spring' & Station == 1,
     Yearf = factor(Year)) %>%
 rename(Season = season,
     Density = combined_density,
     Temp = ave_temp_c,
     Sal = ave_sal_psu,
     Turb = sur_turb,
     AvgTurb = ave_turb_ntu,
     DOsat = ave_DO_Saturation,
     Chl = ave_chl_microgperl,
     Fish = `___61`,
     RH = Herring
     ) %>%
 select(Date, Station, Year, Yearf, Month, Season, is_sp_up, DOY, riv_km, 
     disch_wk, disch_day, disch_max,
     Temp, Sal, Turb, AvgTurb, DOsat, Chl, 
     Fish, RH, 
     Density, H, SEI,
     Acartia, Balanus, Eurytemora, Polychaete, Pseudocal, Temora) %>%
 arrange(Date, Station)
head(base_data)
```

```{r}
rm(station_data)
```

## Complete Cases
This drops only two samples, one for missing Zooplankton data, one for missing
fish data. We need this reduced data set to run The `step()` function. It
makes little sense to try stepwise model selection if each time you add or 
remove a variable, the sample you are studying changes. Since fish is never an
important predictor, we will want need to refit models after stepwise elimination
to use the most complete possible data set.

```{r}
complete_data <- base_data %>%
 select(Season, Station, Yearf,
     is_sp_up, Temp, Sal, Turb, Chl, Fish, RH,
     Density, H, 
     Acartia, Balanus, Eurytemora, Polychaete, Pseudocal, Temora) %>%
 filter(complete.cases(.))
```

## Reduced Data
The low salinity spring samples are doing something rather different, and they
complicate model fitting. Models are far better behaved if we exclude a few
extreme samples. These are low salinity low zooplankton samples. We have two 
complementary ways to specify which samples to omit, without just omitting
"outliers". The first is to restrict modeling to "marine" samples over a certain salinity, and the other is to omit spring upstream samples, which include most
of the problematic samples.

```{r}
drop_low <- complete_data %>%
 filter(Sal > 10)  # Pulls three samples, including one fall upstream sample
           # a fourth low salinity sample lacks zooplankton data
#drop_sp_up <- complete_data %>%
# filter(! is_sp_up) # drops four samples
```

# Models of Fish Abundance
## Model 1
```{r}
fish_gam_ss <- gam(log1p(Fish) ~
                  Season +
                  Station +
                  s(log(Turb), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                  s(log(Chl), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                  s(log1p(Density), bs="ts", k = 5) +
                  s(Yearf, bs = 're'),
                data = complete_data, family = 'gaussian')
summary(fish_gam_ss)
```

Note that the model  explains on the order of 39% of the variance. That is 
actually slightly better than the model based on quantitative environmental
predictors (in spite of the fact that neither Season nor Station is significant 
by ANOVA).

```{r}
anova(fish_gam_ss)
```
### Plot GAM Results
```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,3))
plot(fish_gam_ss)
par(oldpar)
```

The GAM fit continues to be highly influenced by a low Density sample with very 
few fish.

### Plot Season and Station
Seasons don't differ consistently enough to rise above other sources of 
variation.

```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.5}
emms <- emmeans(fish_gam_ss, ~Season)
pairs(emms)

plot(emms) +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab('Fish Density')
```

Neither do Stations,

```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.5}
emms <- emmeans(fish_gam_ss, ~Station, type = 'response')
pairs(emms)

plot(emms) +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab('Fish Density')
```

### Concurvidity Analysis
A common recommendation is that values over 0.8 are problematic. We have no
problems here.
```{r}
concurvity(fish_gam_ss)
```

### Model Diagnostics
```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
gam.check(fish_gam_ss)
par(oldpar)
```

The model is pretty good, with slightly skewed and slightly heavy tails
to the residuals.

## Model on Reduced Data
We refit to data that omits samples where salinity was below 10 PSU.

This reduced data set drops he lowest fish abundance sample in the data set, 
because it happened to coincide with a low salinity (and low plankton density 
sample.

```{r}
fish_gam_ss_no_low <- gam(log1p(Fish) ~
                         Season +
                         Station +
                         s(log(Turb), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                         s(log(Chl), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                         s(log1p(Density), bs="ts", k = 5) +
                         s(Yearf, bs = 're'),
                       data = drop_low, family = 'gaussian')
summary(fish_gam_ss_no_low)
```

This model explains 42% of the variance, quite a bit better than the equivalent model based only on the quantitative environmental predictors.  Fish abundance
(in our true "marine" sample) does appear to be affected by time of year
and possibly by zooplanktn density.

```{r}
anova(fish_gam_ss_no_low)
```
### Plot GAM Results
```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,3))
plot(fish_gam_ss_no_low)
par(oldpar)
```

### Plot Season and Station
While Seasons differ by ANOVA, no pairwise comparisons are significant. Noise
in this relatinship if fairly high, obscuring patterns.

```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.5}
emms <- emmeans(fish_gam_ss_no_low, ~Season, type = 'response')
pairs(emms)

plot(emms) +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab('Fish Density')
```

A similar finding for Station:  while there are some suggestive patterns, none
rise above the noise.

```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.5}
emms <- emmeans(fish_gam_ss_no_low, ~Station, type = 'response')
pairs(emms)

plot(emms) +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab('Fish Density')
```
### Model Diagnostics
```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
gam.check(fish_gam_ss_no_low)
par(oldpar)
```

That model is fairly robust, although it shows some signs of kurtosis again


# Total Zooplankton Density
I fit the simplified model without Station. The full model has the same
concurvity problems as before, and here the model fails to converge. While I
could alter the convergence criteria to search for a solution, we know the model
that includes Station will have concurvity problems, so there is little point.

## Model 1
```{r}
density_gam<- gam(log(Density) ~ 
                    Season +
                    Station +
                    s(log(Turb), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                    s(log(Chl), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                    s(log1p(Fish),bs="ts", k = 5) +
                    s(Yearf, bs = 're'), 
                  data = complete_data, family = 'gaussian')
summary(density_gam)
```

This model explains a far lower proportion of hte variance than the model based
solely on quantitative predictors.

```{r}
anova(density_gam)
```

The only significant pattern is with fish abundance.  Zooplankton density tends
to increase along with fish abundance.

### Plot the GAM
```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,3))
plot(density_gam)
par(oldpar)
```

### Plot Season and Station
We see absolutely no pattern with either Season or Station.

```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.5}
emms <- emmeans(density_gam, ~Season)
pairs(emms)

plot(emms) +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab('Fish Density')
```

```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.5}
emms <- emmeans(density_gam, ~Station, type = 'response')
pairs(emms)

plot(emms) +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab('Fish Density')
```

## Model on Reduced Data
```{r}
density_gam_ss_no_low<- gam(log(Density) ~ 
                              Season +
                              Station +
                              s(log(Turb), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                              s(log(Chl), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                              s(log1p(Fish),bs="ts", k = 5) +
                              s(Yearf, bs = 're'), 
                            data = drop_low, family = 'gaussian')
summary(density_gam_ss_no_low)
```

```{r}
anova(density_gam_ss_no_low)
```

When we eliminate a few low salinity samples (Salinity < 10 PSU), we uncover
several patterns that were previously obscured.  Zooplankton tend to be
higher under higher chlorophyll and higher under higher Turbidity.

### Plot the GAM
```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,3))
plot(density_gam_ss_no_low)
par(oldpar)
```

### Plot Season and Station
```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.5}
emms <- emmeans(density_gam_ss_no_low, ~Season)
pairs(emms)

plot(emms) +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab('Fish Density')
```


And spring emerges as having higher zooplankton abundance (except for those very low salinity samples.)

```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.5}
emms <- emmeans(density_gam_ss_no_low, ~Station, type = 'response')
pairs(emms)

plot(emms) +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab('Fish Density')
```

# Shannon Diversity
## Model 1
```{r}
shannon_gam_ss <- gam(H ~ 
                      Season +
                      Station +
                      s(log(Turb), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                      s(log(Chl), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                      s(log1p(Fish),bs="ts", k = 5) +
                      s(Yearf, bs = 're'),
                    data = complete_data, family = 'gaussian')
summary(shannon_gam_ss)
```

Again, the variance explained is quite small compared to the models based on 
qunatitative predictors.

```{r}
anova(shannon_gam_ss)
```

Nothing appears statistically significant. The error bands are huge....

### Plot the GAM
```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,3))
plot(shannon_gam_ss)
par(oldpar)
```

### Plot Season and Station

```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.5}
emms <- emmeans(shannon_gam_ss, ~Season)
pairs(emms)

plot(emms) +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab('Fish Density')
```



```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.5}
emms <- emmeans(shannon_gam_ss, ~Station, type = 'response')
pairs(emms)

plot(emms) +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab('Fish Density')
```


## Model on Reduced Data
```{r}
shannon_gam_ss_no_low <- gam(H ~ 
                               Season +
                               Station +
                               s(log(Turb), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                               s(log(Chl), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                               s(log1p(Fish),bs="ts", k = 5) +
                               s(Yearf, bs = 're'),
                             data = drop_low, family = 'gaussian')
summary(shannon_gam_ss_no_low)
```

This model actually performs slightly better than the equivalent model based on
quantitative predictors.

```{r}
anova(shannon_gam_ss_no_low)
```

### Plot the GAM
```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,3))
plot(shannon_gam_ss_no_low)
par(oldpar)
```

Plankton diversity is highest at intermediate levels and at low fish abundance. 
(But compare results for other models....).

### Plot Season and Station
```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.5}
emms <- emmeans(shannon_gam_ss_no_low, ~Season)
pairs(emms)

plot(emms) +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab('Fish Density')
```

Upstream has lower zooplankton diversity than downstream.

```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.5}
emms <- emmeans(shannon_gam_ss_no_low, ~Station, type = 'response')
pairs(emms)

plot(emms) +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab('Fish Density')
```

## Diagnostic Plots
```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
gam.check(shannon_gam_ss_no_low)
par(oldpar)
```

Model looks excellent.

# Single Species Models
## Automating Analysis of Separate Species
I'm going to automate analysis of all selected species by using a "nested"
Tibble. This is a convenient alternative to writing a "for" loop to run
multiple identical analyses.

I create a "long" data source, based on the reduced data set that omits low
salinity samples.

```{r}
spp_data <- drop_low %>%
 select(Yearf, Season, Station, Temp,
     Sal, Turb, Chl, Fish, 
     Acartia, Balanus, Eurytemora, Polychaete, Pseudocal, Temora) %>%
 pivot_longer(-c(Yearf:Fish), names_to = 'Species', values_to = 'Density')
```

Next, I create a function to run the analysis. This function takes a data frame
or tibble as an argument. The tibble mush have data columns with the correct 
names.

The initial model fits for some species had a lot of wiggles in them, to an 
extent that I thought did not make much scientific sense, so I decided to reduce
the dimensionality of the GAM smoothers, by adding the parameter `k= 4`. Lowe
numbers constrain the GAM to fit smoother lines.

```{r}
my_gam <- function(.dat) {
  gam(log1p(Density) ~ 
        Season +
        Station +
        s(log(Turb), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
        s(log(Chl), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
        s(log1p(Fish),bs="ts", k = 5) +
        s(Yearf, bs = 're'),
      data = .dat, family = "gaussian")
}
```

Next, I create the nested tibble, and conduct the analysis on each species....

```{r}
spp_analysis <- spp_data %>%
 group_by(Species) %>%
 nest() %>%
 mutate(gam_mods = map(data, my_gam))
```

and finally, output the model results. I can do that in a "for" loop, but it's 
Awkward to look through a long list of output, so I step through each species in turn.
